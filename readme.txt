Challenges/Learning Experiences:
    -This one is silly but very time consuming. For a long time I was looking for a way to directly embed this python script 
    into my webpage portfolio. I was thinking I would have a buttonon the website that would launch the GUI and show off the final 
    product. Apparently, thats not how a tkinter GUI works. One would have to download it... I'm still looking for information on this 
    subject but for now I settle for linking to my source code in github repositories
        -I was trying to implement flask without success.

    - Getting the different time for different zone was a learning experience. I didnt realize I needed to use pytz modules

    - This was my first time using tkinter so I learned a lot about GUI use
